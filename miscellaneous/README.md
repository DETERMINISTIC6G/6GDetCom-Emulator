### Miscellaneous
This folder contains miscellaneous scripts that were used to test the QDISC. We seperated these scripts into two groups: 


1. Tools used to measure data [here](measure/README.md)
2. Tools used to visualize the measured data [here](plot/README.md)

Note: These scripts were only designed for our testing setup and workflow and will, therefore, most likely not work in different setups without alterations.
